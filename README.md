# Cars Classic Model Retail Project - SQL
## Introduction
This project showcases my domain knowledge in data analysis by applying it to a real-world business context not just for querying data using SQL, but for uncovering insights that provide meaningful business relevance and support data-driven decision-making. It was part of my course in Udemy for data analyst course.
## Project Background
The Classic Model dataset represents a retailer of scale models of classic cars, and the data ranges from 2003 to mid-2005. This organization focuses on B2B sales to retailers. This contains a significant amount of information in a typical business relating to product sales and sales by specific team members within the organization.

This project thoroughly analyzes and synthesizes the data to uncover critical insights such as the overall sales performance within the organization, as well as the sales representatives who had the largest impact on sales.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
* __Regional Sales Performance:__ Evaluation of historical sales patterns across different countries focusing on regional performance, order volume and Average Order Value (AOV).
* __Product Level Performance:__ An analysis of various products and product lines, understanding their impact on sales including product profitability and the top 10 best-selling products. 
* __Operational Efficiency:__ An analysis of logistics performance on orders shipped on time.
* __Top Performers:__ An evaluation of sales representatives who had the largest impact on sales.
* __Top Spenders & Loyal Customers:__ A segmentation of customer loyalty and retention.
